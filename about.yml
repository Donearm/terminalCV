    I work as a system engineer and all around developer.
    I am specialized in Python backends but have a vast
    background in many other languages (Lua, Go, C, and
    some Lisp's dialects). Currently improving towards
    frontend development in JavaScript (mostly NodeJS as
    backend and AngularJS as frontend). Dabbled in various
    different databases (SQL and NoSQL). If you are interested
    in my work, take a look at my blog
